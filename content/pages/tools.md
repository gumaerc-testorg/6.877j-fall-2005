The lab assignments in the course made use of several software programs. Detailed instructions for how the tools were used can be found in the lab assignments in the {{% resource_link 05bb9721-7533-33e3-81a0-181ca03c40a7 "labs" %}} section.

Populus
-------

Populus is produced by Don Alstad at the University of Minnesota to foster instruction in population biology. The Populus software contains a set of simulations that are used to teach population biology and evolutionary ecology. For more information and to download Populus, visit their {{% resource_link "a7fa7fcb-2936-4e31-af5a-676e2d4a17f1" "Web site" %}}.

PopG
----

PopG is a one-locus, two-allele genetic simulation program created by University of Washington and Joseph Felsenstein. To download PopG, visit their {{% resource_link "b6a56171-e1e5-441f-ad0c-346357c0698c" "Web site" %}}.

CoalFace
--------

CoalFace is a simulation of the coalescent process with the visual display of gene genealogies, developed by Wayne Delport & Michael Cunningham at the University of Pretoria. CoalFace has been developed predominantly as a teaching tool, yet some basic coalescent simulation analyses can be performed.

Both Windows® and Linux® (Intel) executables are available at their {{% resource_link "5ddb7467-c04e-4157-8a75-07a37382d882" "Web site" %}}.

PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood)
--------------------------------------------------
